  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major carbohydrate transport system in oral streptococci. The mannose-PTS
	of Streptococcus mutans, which transports mannose and glucose, is
	involved in carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and regulates the
	expression of known virulence genes. In this study, we investigated
	the role of EII(Glc) and EIIAB(Man) in sugar metabolism, gene regulation,
	biofilm formation, and competence. The results demonstrate that the
	inactivation of ptsG, encoding a putative EII(Glc), did not lead
	to major changes in sugar metabolism or affect the phenotypes of
	interest. However, the loss of EII(Glc) was shown to have a significant
	impact on the proteome and to affect the expression of a known virulence
	factor, fructan hydrolase (fruA). JAM1, a mutant strain lacking EIIAB(Man),
	had an impaired capacity to form biofilms in the presence of glucose
	and displayed a decreased ability to be transformed with exogenous
	DNA. Also, the lactose- and cellobiose-PTSs were positively and negatively
	regulated by EIIAB(Man), respectively. Microarrays were used to investigate
	the profound phenotypic changes displayed by JAM1, revealing that
	EIIAB(Man) of S. mutans has a key regulatory role in energy metabolism,
	possibly by sensing the energy levels of the cells or the carbohydrate
	availability and, in response, regulating the activity of transcription
	factors and carbohydrate transporters.},

  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major sugar uptake system in oral streptococci. The role of EIIAB(Man)
	(encoded by manL) in gene regulation and sugar transport was investigated
	in Streptococcus mutans UA159. The manL knockout strain, JAM1, grew
	more slowly than the wild-type strain in glucose but grew faster
	in mannose and did not display diauxic growth, indicating that EIIAB(Man)
	is involved in sugar uptake and in carbohydrate catabolite repression.
	PTS assays of JAM1, and of strains lacking the inducible (fruI) and
	constitutive (fruCD) EII fructose, revealed that S. mutans EIIAB(Man)
	transported mannose and glucose and provided evidence that there
	was also a mannose-inducible or glucose-repressible mannose PTS.
	Additionally, there appears to be a fructose PTS that is different
	than FruI and FruCD. To determine whether EIIAB(Man) controlled expression
	of the known virulence genes, glucosyltransferases (gtfBC) and fructosyltransferase
	(ftf) promoter fusions of these genes were established in the wild-type
	and EIIAB(Man)-deficient strains. In the manL mutant, the level of
	chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed from the gtfBC
	promoter was up to threefold lower than that seen with the wild-type
	strain at pH 6 and 7, indicating that EIIAB(Man) is required for
	optimal expression of gtfBC. No significant differences were observed
	between the mutant and the wild-type background in ftf regulation,
	with the exception that under glucose-limiting conditions at pH 7,
	the mutant exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in ftf expression. Two-dimensional
	gel analysis of batch-grown cells of the EIIAB(Man)-deficient strain
	indicated that the expression of at least 38 proteins was altered
	compared to that seen with the wild-type strain, revealing that EIIAB(Man)
	has a pleiotropic effect on gene expression.},

	It can be divided into four different serotypes (c, e, f, and k),

	In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to OMZ175 and B14,
	three other strains (NCTC11060, LM7, and OM50E) of the less prevalent
	serotypes e and f are able to invade primary human coronary artery
	endothelial cells (HCAEC). Invasive strains were also significantly
	more virulent than noninvasive strains in the Galleria mellonella
	(greater wax worm) model of systemic disease. Interestingly, the
	invasive strains carried an additional gene, cnm, which was previously
	shown to bind to collagen and laminin in vitro. Inactivation of cnm
	rendered the organisms unable to invade HCAEC and attenuated their
	virulence in G. mellonella. Notably, the cnm knockout strains did
	not adhere to HCAEC as efficiently as the parental strains did, indicating
	that the loss of the invasion phenotype observed for the mutants
	was linked to an adhesion defect. Comparisons of the invasive strains
	and their respective cnm mutants did not support a correlation between
	biofilm formation and invasion. Thus, Cnm is required for S. mutans
	invasion of endothelial cells and possibly represents an important
	virulence factor of S. mutans that may contribute to cardiovascular
	infections and pathologies.},

  abstract = {CcpA globally regulates transcription in response to carbohydrate
	availability in many gram-positive bacteria, but its role in Streptococcus
	mutans remains enigmatic. Using the fructan hydrolase (fruA) gene
	of S. mutans as a model, we demonstrated that CcpA plays a direct
	role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Subsequently, the expression
	of 170 genes was shown to be differently expressed (> or = 2-fold)
	in glucose-grown wild-type (UA159) and CcpA-deficient (TW1) strains
	(P < or = 0.001). However, there were differences in expression of
	only 96 genes between UA159 and TW1 when cells were cultivated with
	the poorly repressing substrate galactose. Interestingly, 90 genes
	were expressed differently in wild-type S. mutans when glucose- and
	galactose-grown cells were compared, but the expression of 515 genes
	was altered in the CcpA-deficient strain in a similar comparison.
	Overall, our results supported the hypothesis that CcpA has a major
	role in CCR and regulation of gene expression but revealed that in
	S. mutans there is a substantial CcpA-independent network that regulates
	gene expression in response to the carbohydrate source. Based on
	the genetic studies, biochemical and physiological experiments demonstrated
	that loss of CcpA impacts the ability of S. mutans to transport and
	grow on selected sugars. Also, the CcpA-deficient strain displayed
	an enhanced capacity to produce acid from intracellular stores of
	polysaccharides, could grow faster at pH 5.5, and could acidify the
	environment more rapidly and to a greater extent than the parental
	strain. Thus, CcpA directly modulates the pathogenic potential of
	S. mutans through global control of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Improving the accuracy of prediction of gene starts is one of a few
	remaining open problems in computer prediction of prokaryotic genes.
	Its difficulty is caused by the absence of relatively strong sequence
	patterns identifying true translation initiation sites. In the current
	paper we show that the accuracy of gene start prediction can be improved
	by combining models of protein-coding and non-coding regions and
	models of regulatory sites near gene start within an iterative Hidden
	Markov model based algorithm. The new gene prediction method, called
	GeneMarkS, utilizes a non-supervised training procedure and can be
	used for a newly sequenced prokaryotic genome with no prior knowledge
	of any protein or rRNA genes. The GeneMarkS implementation uses an
	improved version of the gene finding program GeneMark.hmm, heuristic
	Markov models of coding and non-coding regions and the Gibbs sampling
	multiple alignment program. GeneMarkS predicted precisely 83.2\%
	of the translation starts of GenBank annotated Bacillus subtilis
	genes and 94.4\% of translation starts in an experimentally validated
	set of Escherichia coli genes. We have also observed that GeneMarkS
	detects prokaryotic genes, in terms of identifying open reading frames
	containing real genes, with an accuracy matching the level of the
	best currently used gene detection methods. Accurate translation
	start prediction, in addition to the refinement of protein sequence
	N-terminal data, provides the benefit of precise positioning of the
	sequence region situated upstream to a gene start. Therefore, sequence
	motifs related to transcription and translation regulatory sites
	can be revealed and analyzed with higher precision. These motifs
	were shown to possess a significant variability, the functional and
	evolutionary connections of which are discussed.},

  abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a digital display of a transcriptome using
	next-generation sequencing technologies and provides detailed, high-throughput
	view of the transcriptome. The first step in RNA-Seq is to isolate
	whole transcriptome from total RNA. Since large ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
	constitutes approximately 90\% RNA species in total RNA, whole transcriptome
	analysis without any contamination from rRNA is very difficult using
	existing RNA isolation methods. RiboMinus(â¢) purification method
	provides a novel and efficient method to isolate RNA molecules of
	the transcriptome devoid of large rRNA from total RNA for transcriptome
	analysis. It allows for whole transcriptome isolation through selective
	depletion of abundant rRNA molecules from total RNA. The rRNA depleted
	RNA fraction is termed as RiboMinus(â¢) RNA fraction, which is enriched
	in polyadenylated RNA, nonpolyadenylated RNA, preprocessed RNA, tRNA,
	numerous regulatory RNA molecules, and other RNA transcripts of yet
	unknown function. Using RiboMinus(â¢) method to isolate RiboMinus
	RNA results in up to 99.0\% removal of 16S and 23S rRNA molecules

  abstract = {High-density, strand-specific cDNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) was used
	to analyze the transcriptome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi
	(S. Typhi). By mapping sequence data to the entire S. Typhi genome,
	we analyzed the transcriptome in a strand-specific manner and further
	defined transcribed regions encoded within prophages, pseudogenes,
	previously un-annotated, and 3'- or 5'-untranslated regions (UTR).
	An additional 40 novel candidate non-coding RNAs were identified
	beyond those previously annotated. Proteomic analysis was combined
	with transcriptome data to confirm and refine the annotation of a
	number of hpothetical genes. ssRNA-seq was also combined with microarray
	and proteome analysis to further define the S. Typhi OmpR regulon
	and identify novel OmpR regulated transcripts. Thus, ssRNA-seq provides
	a novel and powerful approach to the characterization of the bacterial
	transcriptome.},

	proteins and genetic diversity of this prevalent human pathogen,
	yet little is known about its transcriptional organization and noncoding
	RNA output. Massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been
	revolutionizing global transcriptomic analysis. Here, using a novel
	differential approach (dRNA-seq) selective for the 5' end of primary
	transcripts, we present a genome-wide map of H. pylori transcriptional
	start sites and operons. We discovered hundreds of transcriptional
	start sites within operons, and opposite to annotated genes, indicating
	that complexity of gene expression from the small H. pylori genome
	is increased by uncoupling of polycistrons and by genome-wide antisense
	transcription. We also discovered an unexpected number of approximately
	60 small RNAs including the epsilon-subdivision counterpart of the
	regulatory 6S RNA and associated RNA products, and potential regulators
	of cis- and trans-encoded target messenger RNAs. Our approach establishes
	a paradigm for mapping and annotating the primary transcriptomes
	of many living species.},
