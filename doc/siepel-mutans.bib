  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major carbohydrate transport system in oral streptococci. The mannose-PTS
	of Streptococcus mutans, which transports mannose and glucose, is
	involved in carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and regulates the
	expression of known virulence genes. In this study, we investigated
	the role of EII(Glc) and EIIAB(Man) in sugar metabolism, gene regulation,
	biofilm formation, and competence. The results demonstrate that the
	inactivation of ptsG, encoding a putative EII(Glc), did not lead
	to major changes in sugar metabolism or affect the phenotypes of
	interest. However, the loss of EII(Glc) was shown to have a significant
	impact on the proteome and to affect the expression of a known virulence
	factor, fructan hydrolase (fruA). JAM1, a mutant strain lacking EIIAB(Man),
	had an impaired capacity to form biofilms in the presence of glucose
	and displayed a decreased ability to be transformed with exogenous
	DNA. Also, the lactose- and cellobiose-PTSs were positively and negatively
	regulated by EIIAB(Man), respectively. Microarrays were used to investigate
	the profound phenotypic changes displayed by JAM1, revealing that
	EIIAB(Man) of S. mutans has a key regulatory role in energy metabolism,
	possibly by sensing the energy levels of the cells or the carbohydrate
	availability and, in response, regulating the activity of transcription
	factors and carbohydrate transporters.},

  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major sugar uptake system in oral streptococci. The role of EIIAB(Man)
	(encoded by manL) in gene regulation and sugar transport was investigated
	in Streptococcus mutans UA159. The manL knockout strain, JAM1, grew
	more slowly than the wild-type strain in glucose but grew faster
	in mannose and did not display diauxic growth, indicating that EIIAB(Man)
	is involved in sugar uptake and in carbohydrate catabolite repression.
	PTS assays of JAM1, and of strains lacking the inducible (fruI) and
	constitutive (fruCD) EII fructose, revealed that S. mutans EIIAB(Man)
	transported mannose and glucose and provided evidence that there
	was also a mannose-inducible or glucose-repressible mannose PTS.
	Additionally, there appears to be a fructose PTS that is different
	than FruI and FruCD. To determine whether EIIAB(Man) controlled expression
	of the known virulence genes, glucosyltransferases (gtfBC) and fructosyltransferase
	(ftf) promoter fusions of these genes were established in the wild-type
	and EIIAB(Man)-deficient strains. In the manL mutant, the level of
	chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed from the gtfBC
	promoter was up to threefold lower than that seen with the wild-type
	strain at pH 6 and 7, indicating that EIIAB(Man) is required for
	optimal expression of gtfBC. No significant differences were observed
	between the mutant and the wild-type background in ftf regulation,
	with the exception that under glucose-limiting conditions at pH 7,
	the mutant exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in ftf expression. Two-dimensional
	gel analysis of batch-grown cells of the EIIAB(Man)-deficient strain
	indicated that the expression of at least 38 proteins was altered
	compared to that seen with the wild-type strain, revealing that EIIAB(Man)
	has a pleiotropic effect on gene expression.},

	It can be divided into four different serotypes (c, e, f, and k),

	In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to OMZ175 and B14,
	three other strains (NCTC11060, LM7, and OM50E) of the less prevalent
	serotypes e and f are able to invade primary human coronary artery
	endothelial cells (HCAEC). Invasive strains were also significantly
	more virulent than noninvasive strains in the Galleria mellonella
	(greater wax worm) model of systemic disease. Interestingly, the
	invasive strains carried an additional gene, cnm, which was previously
	shown to bind to collagen and laminin in vitro. Inactivation of cnm
	rendered the organisms unable to invade HCAEC and attenuated their
	virulence in G. mellonella. Notably, the cnm knockout strains did
	not adhere to HCAEC as efficiently as the parental strains did, indicating
	that the loss of the invasion phenotype observed for the mutants
	was linked to an adhesion defect. Comparisons of the invasive strains
	and their respective cnm mutants did not support a correlation between
	biofilm formation and invasion. Thus, Cnm is required for S. mutans
	invasion of endothelial cells and possibly represents an important
	virulence factor of S. mutans that may contribute to cardiovascular

  abstract = {CcpA globally regulates transcription in response to carbohydrate
	availability in many gram-positive bacteria, but its role in Streptococcus
	mutans remains enigmatic. Using the fructan hydrolase (fruA) gene
	of S. mutans as a model, we demonstrated that CcpA plays a direct
	role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Subsequently, the expression
	of 170 genes was shown to be differently expressed (> or = 2-fold)
	in glucose-grown wild-type (UA159) and CcpA-deficient (TW1) strains
	(P < or = 0.001). However, there were differences in expression of
	only 96 genes between UA159 and TW1 when cells were cultivated with
	the poorly repressing substrate galactose. Interestingly, 90 genes
	were expressed differently in wild-type S. mutans when glucose- and
	galactose-grown cells were compared, but the expression of 515 genes
	was altered in the CcpA-deficient strain in a similar comparison.
	Overall, our results supported the hypothesis that CcpA has a major
	role in CCR and regulation of gene expression but revealed that in
	S. mutans there is a substantial CcpA-independent network that regulates
	gene expression in response to the carbohydrate source. Based on
	the genetic studies, biochemical and physiological experiments demonstrated
	that loss of CcpA impacts the ability of S. mutans to transport and
	grow on selected sugars. Also, the CcpA-deficient strain displayed
	an enhanced capacity to produce acid from intracellular stores of
	polysaccharides, could grow faster at pH 5.5, and could acidify the
	environment more rapidly and to a greater extent than the parental
	strain. Thus, CcpA directly modulates the pathogenic potential of
	S. mutans through global control of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Improving the accuracy of prediction of gene starts is one of a few
	remaining open problems in computer prediction of prokaryotic genes.
	Its difficulty is caused by the absence of relatively strong sequence
	patterns identifying true translation initiation sites. In the current
	paper we show that the accuracy of gene start prediction can be improved
	by combining models of protein-coding and non-coding regions and
	models of regulatory sites near gene start within an iterative Hidden
	Markov model based algorithm. The new gene prediction method, called
	GeneMarkS, utilizes a non-supervised training procedure and can be
	used for a newly sequenced prokaryotic genome with no prior knowledge
	of any protein or rRNA genes. The GeneMarkS implementation uses an
	improved version of the gene finding program GeneMark.hmm, heuristic
	Markov models of coding and non-coding regions and the Gibbs sampling
	multiple alignment program. GeneMarkS predicted precisely 83.2\%
	of the translation starts of GenBank annotated Bacillus subtilis
	genes and 94.4\% of translation starts in an experimentally validated
	set of Escherichia coli genes. We have also observed that GeneMarkS
	detects prokaryotic genes, in terms of identifying open reading frames
	containing real genes, with an accuracy matching the level of the
	best currently used gene detection methods. Accurate translation
	start prediction, in addition to the refinement of protein sequence
	N-terminal data, provides the benefit of precise positioning of the
	sequence region situated upstream to a gene start. Therefore, sequence
	motifs related to transcription and translation regulatory sites
	can be revealed and analyzed with higher precision. These motifs
	were shown to possess a significant variability, the functional and
	evolutionary connections of which are discussed.},

  pages = {350},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of non-coding transcripts in human,
	mouse, and Escherichia coli has revealed their widespread occurrence
	and functional importance in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic life.
	In prokaryotes, studies have shown that non-coding transcripts participate
	in a broad range of cellular functions like gene regulation, stress
	and virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts
	in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an obligate human respiratory
	pathogen responsible for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality.
	Tiling microarrays enable genome wide mRNA profiling as well as identification
	of novel transcripts at a high-resolution. RESULTS: Here, we describe
	a high-resolution transcription map of the S. pneumoniae clinical
	isolate TIGR4 using genomic tiling arrays. Our results indicate that
	approximately 66\% of the genome is expressed under our experimental
	conditions. We identified a total of 50 non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs)
	from the intergenic regions, of which 36 had no predicted function.
	Half of the identified sRNA sequences were found to be unique to
	S. pneumoniae genome. We identified eight overrepresented sequence
	motifs among sRNA sequences that correspond to sRNAs in different
	functional categories. Tiling arrays also identified approximately
	202 operon structures in the genome. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the
	pneumococcal operon structures and novel sRNAs identified in this
	study enhance our understanding of the complexity and extent of the
	pneumococcal 'expressed' genome. Furthermore, the results of this
	study open up new avenues of research for understanding the complex
	RNA regulatory network governing S. pneumoniae physiology and virulence.},

	technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment
	programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been

	does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes
	it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur
	frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment
	is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented
	Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package
	that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT),
	to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference
	sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.
	BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing
	machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations
	on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately
	10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,

  abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE)
	technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future
	for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental
	data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves
	determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript
	or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions.
	edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential
	expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model
	is used to account for both biological and technical variability.
	Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion
	across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology
	can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
	at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The
	software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such
	as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely
	available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).},

  abstract = {Bacterial non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) have attracted considerable
	attention due to their ubiquitous nature and contribution to numerous
	cellular processes including survival, adaptation and pathogenesis.
	Existing computational approaches for identifying bacterial sRNAs
	demonstrate varying levels of success and there remains considerable
	room for improvement.Here we have proposed a transcriptional signal-based
	computational method to identify intergenic sRNA transcriptional
	units (TUs) in completely sequenced bacterial genomes. Our sRNAscanner
	tool uses position weight matrices derived from experimentally defined
	E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA promoter and rho-independent terminator
	signals to identify intergenic sRNA TUs through sliding window based
	genome scans. Analysis of genomes representative of twelve species
	suggested that sRNAscanner demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to
	sRNAPredict2, the best performing bioinformatics tool available presently.
	However, each algorithm yielded substantial numbers of known and
	uncharacterized hits that were unique to one or the other tool only.
	sRNAscanner identified 118 novel putative intergenic sRNA genes in
	Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2, none of which were flagged by
	sRNAPredict2. Candidate sRNA locations were compared with available
	deep sequencing libraries derived from Hfq-co-immunoprecipitated
	RNA purified from a second Typhimurium strain (Sittka et al. (2008)
	PLoS Genetics 4: e1000163). Sixteen potential novel sRNAs computationally
	predicted and detected in deep sequencing libraries were selected
	for experimental validation by Northern analysis using total RNA
	isolated from bacteria grown under eleven different growth conditions.
	RNA bands of expected sizes were detected in Northern blots for six
	of the examined candidates. Furthermore, the 5'-ends of these six
	Northern-supported sRNA candidates were successfully mapped using
	5'-RACE analysis.We have developed, computationally examined and
	experimentally validated the sRNAscanner algorithm. Data derived
	from this study has successfully identified six novel S. Typhimurium
	sRNA genes. In addition, the computational specificity analysis we
	have undertaken suggests that approximately 40\% of sRNAscanner hits
	with high cumulative sum of scores represent genuine, undiscovered
	sRNA genes. Collectively, these data strongly support the utility
	of sRNAscanner and offer a glimpse of its potential to reveal large
	numbers of sRNA genes that have to date defied identification. sRNAscanner
	is available from: http://bicmku.in:8081/sRNAscanner or http://cluster.physics.iisc.ernet.in/sRNAscanner/.},

	by Livny et al. (J. Livny, A. Brencic, S. Lory, and M. K. Waldor,
	Nucleic Acids Res. 34:3484-3493, 2006), we tested 40 candidates by
	Northern blotting and confirmed the expression of nine new and one
	previously reported (CcnA) sRNAs in strain D39. CcnA is one of five
	redundant sRNAs reported by Halfmann et al. (A. Halfmann, M. Kovacs,
	R. Hakenbeck, and R. Bruckner, Mol. Microbiol. 66:110-126, 2007)
	that are positively controlled by the CiaR response regulator. We
	characterized 3 of these 14 sRNAs: Spd-sr17 (144 nucleotides [nt];
	decreased in stationary phase), Spd-sr37 (80 nt; strongly expressed
	in all growth phases), and CcnA (93 nt; induced by competence stimulatory
	peptide). Spd-sr17 and CcnA likely fold into structures containing
	single-stranded regions between hairpin structures, whereas Spd-sr37
	forms a base-paired structure. Primer extension mapping and ectopic
	expression in deletion/insertion mutants confirmed the independent
	expression of the three sRNAs. Microarray analyses indicated that
	insertion/deletion mutants in spd-sr37 and ccnA exerted strong cis-acting
	effects on the transcription of adjacent genes, indicating that these
	sRNA regions are also cotranscribed in operons. Deletion or overexpression
	of the three sRNAs did not cause changes in growth, certain stress
	responses, global transcription, or virulence. Constitutive ectopic
	expression of CcnA reversed some phenotypes of D39 Delta ciaR mutants,
	but attempts to link CcnA to -E to comC as a target were inconclusive
	in ciaR(+) strains. These results show that S. pneumoniae, which
	lacks known RNA chaperones, expresses numerous sRNAs, but three of
	these sRNAs do not strongly affect common phenotypes or transcription
	patterns.},
