  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major carbohydrate transport system in oral streptococci. The mannose-PTS
	of Streptococcus mutans, which transports mannose and glucose, is
	involved in carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and regulates the
	expression of known virulence genes. In this study, we investigated
	the role of EII(Glc) and EIIAB(Man) in sugar metabolism, gene regulation,
	biofilm formation, and competence. The results demonstrate that the
	inactivation of ptsG, encoding a putative EII(Glc), did not lead
	to major changes in sugar metabolism or affect the phenotypes of
	interest. However, the loss of EII(Glc) was shown to have a significant
	impact on the proteome and to affect the expression of a known virulence
	factor, fructan hydrolase (fruA). JAM1, a mutant strain lacking EIIAB(Man),
	had an impaired capacity to form biofilms in the presence of glucose
	and displayed a decreased ability to be transformed with exogenous
	DNA. Also, the lactose- and cellobiose-PTSs were positively and negatively
	regulated by EIIAB(Man), respectively. Microarrays were used to investigate
	the profound phenotypic changes displayed by JAM1, revealing that
	EIIAB(Man) of S. mutans has a key regulatory role in energy metabolism,
	possibly by sensing the energy levels of the cells or the carbohydrate
	availability and, in response, regulating the activity of transcription
	factors and carbohydrate transporters.},

  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major sugar uptake system in oral streptococci. The role of EIIAB(Man)
	(encoded by manL) in gene regulation and sugar transport was investigated
	in Streptococcus mutans UA159. The manL knockout strain, JAM1, grew
	more slowly than the wild-type strain in glucose but grew faster
	in mannose and did not display diauxic growth, indicating that EIIAB(Man)
	is involved in sugar uptake and in carbohydrate catabolite repression.
	PTS assays of JAM1, and of strains lacking the inducible (fruI) and
	constitutive (fruCD) EII fructose, revealed that S. mutans EIIAB(Man)
	transported mannose and glucose and provided evidence that there
	was also a mannose-inducible or glucose-repressible mannose PTS.
	Additionally, there appears to be a fructose PTS that is different
	than FruI and FruCD. To determine whether EIIAB(Man) controlled expression
	of the known virulence genes, glucosyltransferases (gtfBC) and fructosyltransferase
	(ftf) promoter fusions of these genes were established in the wild-type
	and EIIAB(Man)-deficient strains. In the manL mutant, the level of
	chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed from the gtfBC
	promoter was up to threefold lower than that seen with the wild-type
	strain at pH 6 and 7, indicating that EIIAB(Man) is required for
	optimal expression of gtfBC. No significant differences were observed
	between the mutant and the wild-type background in ftf regulation,
	with the exception that under glucose-limiting conditions at pH 7,
	the mutant exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in ftf expression. Two-dimensional
	gel analysis of batch-grown cells of the EIIAB(Man)-deficient strain
	indicated that the expression of at least 38 proteins was altered
	compared to that seen with the wild-type strain, revealing that EIIAB(Man)
	has a pleiotropic effect on gene expression.},

	It can be divided into four different serotypes (c, e, f, and k),
	with serotype c strains being the most common in the oral cavity.
	In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to OMZ175 and B14,
	three other strains (NCTC11060, LM7, and OM50E) of the less prevalent
	serotypes e and f are able to invade primary human coronary artery
	endothelial cells (HCAEC). Invasive strains were also significantly
	more virulent than noninvasive strains in the Galleria mellonella
	(greater wax worm) model of systemic disease. Interestingly, the
	invasive strains carried an additional gene, cnm, which was previously
	shown to bind to collagen and laminin in vitro. Inactivation of cnm
	rendered the organisms unable to invade HCAEC and attenuated their
	virulence in G. mellonella. Notably, the cnm knockout strains did
	not adhere to HCAEC as efficiently as the parental strains did, indicating
	that the loss of the invasion phenotype observed for the mutants
	was linked to an adhesion defect. Comparisons of the invasive strains
	and their respective cnm mutants did not support a correlation between
	biofilm formation and invasion. Thus, Cnm is required for S. mutans
	invasion of endothelial cells and possibly represents an important
	virulence factor of S. mutans that may contribute to cardiovascular
	infections and pathologies.},

  abstract = {CcpA globally regulates transcription in response to carbohydrate
	availability in many gram-positive bacteria, but its role in Streptococcus
	mutans remains enigmatic. Using the fructan hydrolase (fruA) gene
	of S. mutans as a model, we demonstrated that CcpA plays a direct
	role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Subsequently, the expression
	of 170 genes was shown to be differently expressed (> or = 2-fold)
	in glucose-grown wild-type (UA159) and CcpA-deficient (TW1) strains
	(P < or = 0.001). However, there were differences in expression of
	only 96 genes between UA159 and TW1 when cells were cultivated with
	the poorly repressing substrate galactose. Interestingly, 90 genes
	were expressed differently in wild-type S. mutans when glucose- and
	galactose-grown cells were compared, but the expression of 515 genes
	was altered in the CcpA-deficient strain in a similar comparison.
	Overall, our results supported the hypothesis that CcpA has a major
	role in CCR and regulation of gene expression but revealed that in
	S. mutans there is a substantial CcpA-independent network that regulates
	gene expression in response to the carbohydrate source. Based on
	the genetic studies, biochemical and physiological experiments demonstrated
	that loss of CcpA impacts the ability of S. mutans to transport and
	grow on selected sugars. Also, the CcpA-deficient strain displayed
	an enhanced capacity to produce acid from intracellular stores of
	polysaccharides, could grow faster at pH 5.5, and could acidify the
	environment more rapidly and to a greater extent than the parental
	strain. Thus, CcpA directly modulates the pathogenic potential of
	S. mutans through global control of gene expression.},

  abstract = {The tight control of autolysis by Streptococcus mutans is critical
	for proper virulence gene expression and biofilm formation. A pair
	of dicistronic operons, SMU.575/574 (lrgAB) and SMU.1701/1700 (designated
	cidAB), encode putative membrane proteins that share structural features
	with the bacteriophage-encoded holin family of proteins, which modulate
	host cell lysis during lytic infection. Analysis of S. mutans lrg
	and cid mutants revealed a role for these operons in autolysis, biofilm
	formation, glucosyltransferase expression and oxidative stress tolerance.
	Expression of lrgAB was repressed during early exponential phase
	and was induced over 1000-fold as cells entered late exponential
	phase, whereas cidAB expression declined from early to late exponential
	phase. A two-component system encoded immediately upstream of lrgAB
	(LytST) was required for activation of lrgAB expression, but not
	for cid expression. In addition to availability of oxygen, glucose
	levels were revealed to affect lrg and cid transcription differentially
	and significantly, probably through CcpA (carbon catabolite protein
	A). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the Cid/Lrg system
	can affect several virulence traits of S. mutans, and its expression
	is controlled by two major environmental signals, oxygen and glucose.
	Moreover, cid/lrg expression is tightly regulated by LytST and CcpA.},

  abstract = {Improving the accuracy of prediction of gene starts is one of a few
	remaining open problems in computer prediction of prokaryotic genes.
	Its difficulty is caused by the absence of relatively strong sequence
	patterns identifying true translation initiation sites. In the current
	paper we show that the accuracy of gene start prediction can be improved
	by combining models of protein-coding and non-coding regions and
	models of regulatory sites near gene start within an iterative Hidden
	Markov model based algorithm. The new gene prediction method, called
	GeneMarkS, utilizes a non-supervised training procedure and can be
	used for a newly sequenced prokaryotic genome with no prior knowledge
	of any protein or rRNA genes. The GeneMarkS implementation uses an
	improved version of the gene finding program GeneMark.hmm, heuristic
	Markov models of coding and non-coding regions and the Gibbs sampling
	multiple alignment program. GeneMarkS predicted precisely 83.2\%
	of the translation starts of GenBank annotated Bacillus subtilis
	genes and 94.4\% of translation starts in an experimentally validated
	set of Escherichia coli genes. We have also observed that GeneMarkS
	detects prokaryotic genes, in terms of identifying open reading frames
	containing real genes, with an accuracy matching the level of the
	best currently used gene detection methods. Accurate translation
	start prediction, in addition to the refinement of protein sequence
	N-terminal data, provides the benefit of precise positioning of the
	sequence region situated upstream to a gene start. Therefore, sequence
	motifs related to transcription and translation regulatory sites
	can be revealed and analyzed with higher precision. These motifs
	were shown to possess a significant variability, the functional and
	evolutionary connections of which are discussed.},

	by a whole genome comparison of two ST-474, flaA SVR-14 isolates
	and other available C. jejuni isolates and genomes. The two isolates
	were collected from different sources, human (H22082) and retail
	poultry (P110b), at the same time and from the same geographical
	location. Solexa sequencing of each isolate resulted in ~1.659 Mb
	(H22082) and ~1.656 Mb (P110b) of assembled sequences within 28 (H22082)
	and 29 (P110b) contigs. We analysed 1502 genes for which we had sequences
	within both ST-474 isolates and within at least one of 11 C. jejuni
	reference genomes. Although 94.5\% of genes were identical between
	the two ST-474 isolates, we identified 83 genes that differed by
	at least one nucleotide, including 55 genes with non-synonymous substitutions.
	These covered 101 kb and contained 672 point differences. We inferred
	that 22 (3.3\%) of these differences were due to mutation and 650
	(96.7\%) were imported via recombination. Our analysis estimated
	38 recombinant breakpoints within these 83 genes, which correspond
	to recombination events affecting at least 19 loci regions and gives
	a tract length estimate of ~2 kb. This includes a ~12 kb region displaying
	non-homologous recombination in one of the ST-474 genomes, with the
	insertion of two genes, including ykgC, a putative oxidoreductase,
	and a conserved hypothetical protein of unknown function. Furthermore,
	our analysis indicates that the source of this recombined DNA is
	more likely to have come from C. jejuni strains that are more closely
	related to ST-474. This suggests that the rates of recombination
	and mutation are similar in order of magnitude, but that recombination
	has been much more important for generating divergence between the

	of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest scores
	reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present
	a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously
	unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or
	computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast,
	designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new
	protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.We
	compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive
	POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published
	program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks:
	BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that
	offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed
	(MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two
	(MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on
	all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW
	in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less.
	MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282
	in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.MUSCLE offers a range

	Using the Myrna package, reads were aligned, overlapped with gene

	into Bioconductor ExpressionSet objects for ease of analysis. ReCount
	also contains the Myrna manifest files and R source code used to

	method is most efficient when we allow controlled loss of data in
	the saving of quality information and unaligned sequences. With this
	new compression method we observe exponential efficiency gains as
	read lengths increase, and the magnitude of this efficiency gain
	can be controlled by changing the amount of quality information stored.
	Our compression method is tunable: The storage of quality scores
	and unaligned sequences may be adjusted for different experiments
	to conserve information or to minimize storage costs, and provides
	one opportunity to address the threat that increasing DNA sequence
	volumes will overcome our ability to store the sequences.},

	accuracy is increased by the systematic use of dinucleotide models.
	(2) Technical limitations of the previous version, such as the inability
	to handle alignments with more than six sequences, are overcome by
	increased training data and the usage of an entropy measure to represent
	sequence similarities. RNAz 2.0 shows a significantly lower false
	discovery rate on a dinucleotide background model than the previous
	version. Separate models for structural alignments provide an additional
	way to increase the predictive power. RNAz is open source software
	and can be obtained free of charge at: http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~wash/RNAz/},

	revolution. Increased sequencing capacity and novel tools have made
	it possible to explore the bacterial transcriptome to an unprecedented
	depth, which has revealed that the transcriptome is more complex
	and dynamic than expected. Alternative transcripts within operons
	challenge the classic operon definition, and many small RNAs involved
	in the regulation of transcription, translation and pathogenesis
	have been discovered. Furthermore, mRNAs may localize to specific
	areas in the cell, and the spatial organization and dynamics of the
	chromosome have been shown to be important for transcription. Epigenetic
	modifications of DNA also affect transcription, and RNA processing
	affects translation. Therefore, transcription in bacteria resembles
	that in eukaryotes in terms of complexity more closely than was previously
	thought. Here we will discuss the contribution of 'omics' approaches
	to these discoveries as well as the possible impact that they are
	expected to have in the future.},

  abstract = {Biofilms are highly dynamic, organized and structured communities
	of microbial cells enmeshed in an extracellular matrix of variable
	density and composition (1, 2). In general, biofilms develop from
	initial microbial attachment on a surface followed by formation of
	cell clusters (or microcolonies) and further development and stabilization
	of the microcolonies, which occur in a complex extracellular matrix.
	The majority of biofilm matrices harbor exopolysaccharides (EPS),
	and dental biofilms are no exception; especially those associated
	with caries disease, which are mostly mediated by mutans streptococci
	(3). The EPS are synthesized by microorganisms (S. mutans, a key
	contributor) by means of extracellular enzymes, such as glucosyltransferases
	using sucrose primarily as substrate (3). Studies of biofilms formed
	on tooth surfaces are particularly challenging owing to their constant
	exposure to environmental challenges associated with complex diet-host-microbial
	interactions occurring in the oral cavity. Better understanding of
	the dynamic changes of the structural organization and composition
	of the matrix, physiology and transcriptome/proteome profile of biofilm-cells
	in response to these complex interactions would further advance the
	current knowledge of how oral biofilms modulate pathogenicity. Therefore,
	we have developed an analytical tool-box to facilitate biofilm analysis
	at structural, biochemical and molecular levels by combining commonly
	available and novel techniques with custom-made software for data
	analysis. Standard analytical (colorimetric assays, RT-qPCR and microarrays)
	and novel fluorescence techniques (for simultaneous labeling of bacteria

	is comprised of 4 distinct but interconnected steps (Figure 1): 1)
	Bioassays, 2) Raw Data Input, 3) Data Processing, and 4) Data Analysis.
	We used our in vitro biofilm model and specific experimental conditions
	to demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the tool-box. The
	biofilm model is simple, reproducible and multiple replicates of
	a single experiment can be done simultaneously (4, 5). Moreover,
	it allows temporal evaluation, inclusion of various microbial species
	(5) and assessment of the effects of distinct experimental conditions
	(e.g. treatments (6); comparison of knockout mutants vs. parental

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of non-coding transcripts in human,
	mouse, and Escherichia coli has revealed their widespread occurrence
	and functional importance in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic life.
	In prokaryotes, studies have shown that non-coding transcripts participate
	in a broad range of cellular functions like gene regulation, stress
	and virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts
	in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an obligate human respiratory
	pathogen responsible for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality.
	Tiling microarrays enable genome wide mRNA profiling as well as identification
	of novel transcripts at a high-resolution. RESULTS: Here, we describe
	a high-resolution transcription map of the S. pneumoniae clinical
	isolate TIGR4 using genomic tiling arrays. Our results indicate that
	approximately 66\% of the genome is expressed under our experimental
	conditions. We identified a total of 50 non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs)
	from the intergenic regions, of which 36 had no predicted function.
	Half of the identified sRNA sequences were found to be unique to
	S. pneumoniae genome. We identified eight overrepresented sequence
	motifs among sRNA sequences that correspond to sRNAs in different
	functional categories. Tiling arrays also identified approximately
	202 operon structures in the genome. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the
	pneumococcal operon structures and novel sRNAs identified in this
	study enhance our understanding of the complexity and extent of the
	pneumococcal 'expressed' genome. Furthermore, the results of this
	study open up new avenues of research for understanding the complex
	RNA regulatory network governing S. pneumoniae physiology and virulence.},

	in Streptococcus mutans is a transient and biphasic process, since
	only a subpopulation induces the expression of ComX in the presence
	of CSP, and the activation of the DNA uptake machinery in this fraction
	shuts down ~3 to 4 h postinduction. Here, we combine for the first
	time, to our knowledge, the bacterial flow-cytometric sorting of
	cells and subpopulation-specific transcriptome analysis of both the
	competent and noncompetent fraction of CSP-treated S. mutans cells.
	Sorting was guided by a ComX-green fluorescent protein (ComX-GFP)
	reporter, and the transcriptome analysis demonstrated the successful
	combination of both methods, because a strong enrichment of transcripts
	for comX and its downstream genes was achieved. Three two-component
	systems were expressed in the competent fraction, and among them
	was ComDE. Moreover, the recently identified regulator system ComR/S
	was expressed exclusively in the competent fraction. In contrast,
	the expression of bacteriocin-related genes was at the same level
	in all cells. GFP reporter strains for ComE and CipB (mutacin V)
	confirmed this expression pattern on the single-cell level. Fluorescence
	microscopy revealed that some ComX-expressing cells committed autolysis
	in an early stage of competence initiation. In viable ComX-expressing
	cells, the uptake of DNA could be shown on the single-cell level.
	This study demonstrates that all cells in the population respond
	to CSP through the activation of bacteriocin-related genes. Some
	of these cells start to activate ComX expression but then segregate
	into two subpopulations, one becoming competent and another one that
	lyses, resulting in intrapopulation diversity.},

  abstract = {The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing
	technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment
	programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been
	developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast
	enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ
	does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes
	it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur
	frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment
	is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented
	Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package
	that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT),
	to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference
	sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.
	BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing
	machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations
	on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately
	10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
	BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)

	can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

  abstract = {In the oral biofilm, the 'mitis' streptococci are among the first
	group of organisms to colonize the tooth surface. Their proliferation
	is thought to be an important factor required for antagonizing the
	growth of cariogenic species such as Streptococcus mutans. In this
	study, we used a three-species mixed culture to demonstrate that
	another ubiquitous early colonizing species, Veillonella parvula,
	can greatly affect the outcome of the competition between a pair
	of antagonists such as S. mutans and Streptococcus gordonii. Transcriptome
	analysis further revealed that S. mutans responds differentially
	to its friend (V. parvula) and foe (S. gordonii). In the mixed culture
	with S. gordonii, all but one of the S. mutans sugar uptake and metabolic
	genes were downregulated, while genes for alternative energy source
	utilization and HâOâ tolerance were upregulated, resulting in a slower
	but persistent growth. In contrast, when cultured with V. parvula,
	S. mutans grew equally well or better than in monoculture and exhibited
	relatively few changes within its transcriptome. When V. parvula
	was introduced into the mixed culture of S. mutans and S. gordonii,
	it rescued the growth inhibition of S. mutans. In this three-species
	environment, S. mutans increased the expression of genes required
	for the uptake and metabolism of minor sugars, while genes required
	for oxidative stress tolerance were downregulated. We conclude that
	the major factors that affect the competition between S. mutans and
	S. gordonii are carbohydrate utilization and HâOâ resistance. The
	presence of V. parvula in the tri-species culture mitigates these
	two major factors and allows S. mutans to proliferate, despite the

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing presents several statistical challenges,
	with one of the most fundamental being determining an individual's
	genotype from multiple aligned short read sequences at a position.
	Some simple approaches for genotype calling apply fixed filters,
	such as calling a heterozygote if more than a specified percentage
	of the reads have variant nucleotide calls. Other genotype-calling
	methods, such as MAQ and SOAPsnp, are implementations of Bayes classifiers
	in that they classify genotypes using posterior genotype probabilities.Here,
	we propose a novel genotype-calling algorithm that, in contrast to
	the other methods, estimates parameters underlying the posterior
	probabilities in an adaptive way rather than arbitrarily specifying
	them a priori. The algorithm, which we call SeqEM, applies the well-known
	Expectation-Maximization algorithm to an appropriate likelihood for
	a sample of unrelated individuals with next-generation sequence data,
	leveraging information from the sample to estimate genotype probabilities
	and the nucleotide-read error rate. We demonstrate using analytic
	calculations and simulations that SeqEM results in genotype-call
	error rates as small as or smaller than filtering approaches and
	MAQ. We also apply SeqEM to exome sequence data in eight related
	individuals and compare the results to genotypes from an Illumina
	SNP array, showing that SeqEM behaves well in real data that deviates
	from idealized assumptions.SeqEM offers an improved, robust and flexible

	in systems biology. Here we review each step of the analysis from
	library preparation to the interpretation of the data, with particular
	attention paid to the possible sources of artifacts. Methodological
	requirements and statistical frameworks are often similar in both
	the approaches despite differences in the nature of the data. Tiling
	array analysis does not require rRNA depletion and benefits from
	a more mature computational workflow, whereas RNA-Seq has a clear
	lead in terms of background noise and dynamic range with a considerable
	potential for evolution with the improvements of sequencing technologies.
	Being independent of prior sequence knowledge, RNA-seq will boost
	metatranscriptomics and evolutionary transcriptomics applications.},

	Transcript structure, operon linkages, and information on absolute

	throughout the genome. Further, the sequence data identified previously

	to infect and cause disease. A recently appreciated mechanism of
	regulation is that afforded by small regulatory RNA (sRNA) molecules.
	Here, we set out to assess the prevalence of sRNAs in the human bacterial
	pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS). Genome-wide identification
	of candidate GAS sRNAs was performed through a tiling Affymetrix
	microarray approach and identified 40 candidate sRNAs within the
	M1T1 GAS strain MGAS2221. Together with a previous bioinformatic
	approach this brings the number of novel candidate sRNAs in GAS to
	75, a number that approximates the number of GAS transcription factors.
	Transcripts were confirmed by Northern blot analysis for 16 of 32
	candidate sRNAs tested, and the abundance of several of these sRNAs
	were shown to be temporally regulated. Six sRNAs were selected for
	further study and the promoter, transcriptional start site, and Rho-independent
	terminator identified for each. Significant variation was observed
	between the six sRNAs with respect to their stability during growth,
	and with respect to their inter- and/or intra-serotype-specific levels
	of abundance. To start to assess the contribution of sRNAs to gene
	regulation in M1T1 GAS we deleted the previously described sRNA PEL
	from four clinical isolates. Data from genome-wide expression microarray,
	quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses are consistent with
	PEL having no regulatory function in M1T1 GAS. The finding that candidate
	sRNA molecules are prevalent throughout the GAS genome provides significant
	impetus to the study of this fundamental gene-regulatory mechanism

	an increase in S. mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media pH-value

	a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 S. mutans transcripts were
	identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance

	is used to account for both biological and technical variability.
	Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion
	across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology
	can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
	at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The
	software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such
	as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely
	available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).},

  abstract = {Digital gene expression (DGE) technologies measure gene expression
	by counting sequence tags. They are sensitive technologies for measuring
	gene expression on a genomic scale, without the need for prior knowledge
	of the genome sequence. As the cost of sequencing DNA decreases,
	the number of DGE datasets is expected to grow dramatically. Various
	tests of differential expression have been proposed for replicated
	DGE data using binomial, Poisson, negative binomial or pseudo-likelihood
	(PL) models for the counts, but none of the these are usable when
	the number of replicates is very small.We develop tests using the
	negative binomial distribution to model overdispersion relative to
	the Poisson, and use conditional weighted likelihood to moderate
	the level of overdispersion across genes. Not only is our strategy
	applicable even with the smallest number of libraries, but it also
	proves to be more powerful than previous strategies when more libraries
	are available. The methodology is equally applicable to other counting

	has grown again recently as the cost of sequencing has dramatically
	dropped. Most new sequence assembly software has started by building
	a de Bruijn graph, avoiding the overlap-based methods used previously
	because of the computational cost and complexity of these with very
	large numbers of short reads. Here, we show how to use suffix array-based
	methods that have formed the basis of recent very fast sequence mapping
	algorithms to find overlaps and generate assembly string graphs asymptotically
	faster than previously described algorithms. RESULTS: Standard overlap
	assembly methods have time complexity O(N(2)), where N is the sum
	of the lengths of the reads. We use the Ferragina-Manzini index (FM-index)
	derived from the Burrows-Wheeler transform to find overlaps of length
	at least tau among a set of reads. As well as an approach that finds
	all overlaps then implements transitive reduction to produce a string
	graph, we show how to output directly only the irreducible overlaps,
	significantly shrinking memory requirements and reducing compute
	time to O(N), independent of depth. Overlap-based assembly methods
	naturally handle mixed length read sets, including capillary reads
	or long reads promised by the third generation sequencing technologies.
	The algorithms we present here pave the way for overlap-based assembly
	approaches to be developed that scale to whole vertebrate genome

	attention due to their ubiquitous nature and contribution to numerous
	cellular processes including survival, adaptation and pathogenesis.
	Existing computational approaches for identifying bacterial sRNAs
	demonstrate varying levels of success and there remains considerable
	room for improvement.Here we have proposed a transcriptional signal-based
	computational method to identify intergenic sRNA transcriptional
	units (TUs) in completely sequenced bacterial genomes. Our sRNAscanner
	tool uses position weight matrices derived from experimentally defined
	E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA promoter and rho-independent terminator
	signals to identify intergenic sRNA TUs through sliding window based
	genome scans. Analysis of genomes representative of twelve species
	suggested that sRNAscanner demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to
	sRNAPredict2, the best performing bioinformatics tool available presently.
	However, each algorithm yielded substantial numbers of known and
	uncharacterized hits that were unique to one or the other tool only.
	sRNAscanner identified 118 novel putative intergenic sRNA genes in
	Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2, none of which were flagged by
	sRNAPredict2. Candidate sRNA locations were compared with available
	deep sequencing libraries derived from Hfq-co-immunoprecipitated
	RNA purified from a second Typhimurium strain (Sittka et al. (2008)
	PLoS Genetics 4: e1000163). Sixteen potential novel sRNAs computationally
	predicted and detected in deep sequencing libraries were selected
	for experimental validation by Northern analysis using total RNA
	isolated from bacteria grown under eleven different growth conditions.
	RNA bands of expected sizes were detected in Northern blots for six
	of the examined candidates. Furthermore, the 5'-ends of these six
	Northern-supported sRNA candidates were successfully mapped using
	5'-RACE analysis.We have developed, computationally examined and
	experimentally validated the sRNAscanner algorithm. Data derived
	from this study has successfully identified six novel S. Typhimurium
	sRNA genes. In addition, the computational specificity analysis we
	have undertaken suggests that approximately 40\% of sRNAscanner hits
	with high cumulative sum of scores represent genuine, undiscovered
	sRNA genes. Collectively, these data strongly support the utility
	of sRNAscanner and offer a glimpse of its potential to reveal large
	numbers of sRNA genes that have to date defied identification. sRNAscanner

	(SD) is comprised of two subspecies: S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis
	is both a human commensal organism and a human pathogen, and S. dysgalactiae
	subsp. dysgalactiae is strictly an animal pathogen. Here, we present
	complete genome sequences for both taxa, with analyses involving
	other species of Streptococcus but focusing on adaptation in the
	SD species group. We found little evidence for enrichment in biochemical
	categories of genes carried by each SD strain, however, differences
	in the virulence gene repertoire were apparent. Some of the differences
	could be ascribed to prophage and integrative conjugative elements.
	We identified approximately 9\% of the nonrecombinant core genome
	to be under positive selection, some of which involved known virulence
	factors in other bacteria. Analyses of proteomes by pooling data
	across genes, by biochemical category, clade, or branch, provided
	evidence for increased rates of evolution in several gene categories,
	as well as external branches of the tree. Promoters were primarily
	evolving under purifying selection but with certain categories of
	genes evolving faster. Many of these fast-evolving categories were
	the same as those associated with rapid evolution in proteins. Overall,
	these results suggest that adaptation to changing environments and
	new hosts in the SD species group has involved the acquisition of
	key virulence genes along with selection of orthologous protein-coding
	loci and operon promoters.},

	in addition to 50 small RNAs (<500 nucleotides), at least two of
	which are involved in virulence in mice, we have identified antisense
	RNAs covering several open-reading frames and long overlapping 5'
	and 3' untranslated regions. We discovered that riboswitches can
	act as terminators for upstream genes. When Listeria reaches the
	host intestinal lumen, an extensive transcriptional reshaping occurs
	with a SigB-mediated activation of virulence genes. In contrast,
	in the blood, PrfA controls transcription of virulence genes. Remarkably,
	several non-coding RNAs absent in the non-pathogenic species Listeria
	innocua exhibit the same expression patterns as the virulence genes.
	Together, our data unravel successive and coordinated global transcriptional

	for the estimation of the transcript's abundance using RNA-Seq data
	have been intensively studied, many of which are based on the assumption
	that the short-reads of RNA-Seq are uniformly distributed along the
	transcripts. However, the short-reads are found to be nonuniformly
	distributed along the transcripts, which can greatly reduce the accuracies

	are developed to adjust the biases induced by this nonuniformity,
	utilizing the short-read's empirical distribution in transcript.
	As an alternative, we found that RNA degradation plays a major role

	thus developed a new approach that quantifies the short-read's nonuniform
	distribution by precisely modeling RNA degradation. Our model of
	RNA degradation fits RNA-Seq data quite well, and based on this model,
	a new statistical method was further developed to estimate transcript

  abstract = {Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) by transcriptional regulators follows
	different mechanisms in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
	In gram-positive bacteria, CcpA-dependent CCR is mediated by phosphorylation
	of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system intermediate
	HPr at a serine residue at the expense of ATP. The reaction is catalyzed
	by HPr kinase, which is activated by glycolytic intermediates. In
	this review, the distribution of CcpA-dependent CCR among bacteria
	is investigated by searching the public databases for homologues
	of HPr kinase and HPr-like proteins throughout the bacterial kingdom
	and by analyzing their properties. Homologues of HPr kinase are commonly
	observed in the phylum Firmicutes but are also found in the phyla
	Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Chlorobi, suggesting
	that CcpA-dependent CCR is not restricted to gram-positive bacteria.
	In the alpha and beta subdivisions of the Proteobacteria, the presence
	of HPr kinase appears to be common, while in the gamma subdivision
	it is more of an exception. The genes coding for the HPr kinase homologues
	of the Proteobacteria are in a gene cluster together with an HPr-like
	protein, termed XPr, suggesting a functional relationship. Moreover,
	the XPr proteins contain the serine phosphorylation sequence motif.
	Remarkably, the analysis suggests a possible relation between CcpA-dependent
	gene regulation and the nitrogen regulation system (Ntr) found in
	the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria. The relation is suggested
	by the clustering of CCR and Ntr components on the genome of members
	of the Proteobacteria and by the close phylogenetic relationship
	between XPr and NPr, the HPr-like protein in the Ntr system. In bacteria
	in the phylum Proteobacteria that contain HPr kinase and XPr, the
	latter may be at the center of a complex regulatory network involving
	both CCR and the Ntr system.},

  abstract = {There are two primary levels of control of the expression of the fructanase
	gene (fruA) of Streptococcus mutans: induction by levan, inulin,
	or sucrose and repression in the presence of glucose and other readily
	metabolized sugars. The goals of this study were to assess the functionality
	of putative cis-acting regulatory elements and to begin to identify
	the trans-acting factors involved in induction and catabolite repression
	of fruA. The fruA promoter and its derivatives generated by deletions
	and/or site-directed mutagenesis were fused to a promoterless chloramphenicol
	acetyltransferase (CAT) gene as a reporter, and strains carrying
	the transcriptional fusions were then analyzed for CAT activities
	in response to growth on various carbon sources. A dyadic sequence,
	ATGACA(TC)TGTCAT, located at -72 to -59 relative to the transcription
	initiation site was shown to be essential for expression of fruA.
	Inactivation of the genes that encode fructose-specific enzymes II
	resulted in elevated expression from the fruA promoter, suggesting
	negative regulation of fruA expression by the fructose phosphotransferase
	system. Mutagenesis of a terminator-like structure located in the
	165-base 5' untranslated region of the fruA mRNA or insertional inactivation
	of antiterminator genes revealed that antitermination was not a mechanism
	controlling induction or repression of fruA, although the untranslated
	leader mRNA may play a role in optimal expression of fructanase.
	Deletion or mutation of a consensus catabolite response element alleviated
	glucose repression of fruA, but interestingly, inactivation of the
	ccpA gene had no discernible effect on catabolite repression of fruA.
	Accumulating data suggest that expression of fruA is regulated by
	a mechanism that has several unique features that distinguish it
	from archetypical polysaccharide catabolic operons of other gram-positive
	bacteria.},

	An hprKV265F mutation, which enhanced Ser46 phosphorylation of HPr,
	inhibited growth on multiple PTS sugars. A ptsHS46A mutation reversed
	the effects of hprKV265F in most cases. A strain carrying a ptsHS46D

	CCR of the fruA and levD operons, a phenotype reversible by the ptsHS46A
	mutation. The effects of the hprKV265F mutation on fruA and levD

  abstract = {The ability of Streptococcus mutans to catabolize cellobiose, a beta-linked

	by an operon with a phospho-beta-glucosidase (CelA) and a cellobiose-specific
	sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) permease (EII(Cel)). The roles
	of CelR, EII(Cel) components, and certain fructose/mannose-PTS permeases
	in the transcriptional regulation of the cel locus were analyzed.
	The results revealed that (i) the celA and celB (EIIB(Cel)) gene
	promoters require CelR for transcriptional activation in response
	to cellobiose, but read-through from the celA promoter contributes
	to expression of the EII(Cel) genes; (ii) the EII(Cel) subunits were

	of the cel genes; (iii) CcpA plays little direct role in catabolite
	repression of the cel regulon, but loss of specific PTS permeases
	alleviated repression of cel genes in the presence of preferred carbohydrates;
	and (iv) glucose could induce transcription of the cel regulon when

	be estimated from RNA-Seq data. Despite these advantages, recent
	work revealed that base level read counts from RNA-Seq data may not
	be randomly distributed and can be affected by local nucleotide composition.
	It was not clear though how the base level read count bias may affect
	gene level expression estimates.In this paper, by using five published
	RNA-Seq data sets from different biological sources and with different
	data preprocessing schemes, we showed that commonly used estimates
	of gene expression levels from RNA-Seq data, such as reads per kilobase
	of gene length per million reads (RPKM), are biased in terms of gene
	length, GC content and dinucleotide frequencies. We directly examined
	the biases at the gene-level, and proposed a simple generalized-additive-model
	based approach to correct different sources of biases simultaneously.
	Compared to previously proposed base level correction methods, our
	method reduces bias in gene-level expression estimates more effectively.Our
	method identifies and corrects different sources of biases in gene-level
	expression measures from RNA-Seq data, and provides more accurate
	estimates of gene expression levels from RNA-Seq. This method should
	prove useful in meta-analysis of gene expression levels using different
	platforms or experimental protocols.},

  abstract = {A number of penalization and shrinkage approaches have been proposed
	for the analysis of microarray gene expression data. Similar techniques
	are now routinely applied to RNA sequence transcriptional count data,
	although the value of such shrinkage has not been conclusively established.
	If penalization is desired, the explicit modeling of mean-variance
	relationships provides a flexible testing regimen that 'borrows'
	information across genes, while easily incorporating design effects
	and additional covariates.We describe BBSeq, which incorporates two
	approaches: (i) a simple beta-binomial generalized linear model,
	which has not been extensively tested for RNA-Seq data and (ii) an
	extension of an expression mean-variance modeling approach to RNA-Seq
	data, involving modeling of the overdispersion as a function of the
	mean. Our approaches are flexible, allowing for general handling
	of discrete experimental factors and continuous covariates. We report
	comparisons with other alternate methods to handle RNA-Seq data.
	Although penalized methods have advantages for very small sample
	sizes, the beta-binomial generalized linear model, combined with
	simple outlier detection and testing approaches, appears to have
	favorable characteristics in power and flexibility.An R package containing
	examples and sample datasets is available at http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/BBSeqyzhou@bios.unc.edu;
