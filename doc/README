Questions to be answered
------------------------
. What is the operon map of S. mutans?
. What differential expression is manifested between wild type and mutants such
as ccpA and manL mutants?
. What are ncRNAs and antisense RNAs in S. mutans?
. What are riboswitches in S. mutans?

RNA-seq
-------
. Operon mapping: is strand-specific RNA-seq enough? Should I use differential
RNA-seq? If I use differential RNA-seq, then can I compare expression level
between a wild type and a mutant (or quantitative gene expression studies)?

Studying bacterial transcriptomes using RNA-seq.
Croucher NJ, Thomson NR.
.. ``care should be taken to ensure the method does not bias the sampling of the
transcriptome [5] and is capable of harvesting sufficient starting material
needed to construct a sequen- cing library, as more RNA is typically needed than
for microarray experiments.''
.. ``the use of terminator exonucleases that specifically degrade transcripts
with a 50 monophosphate group''
.. ``obtaining longer reads results in a relatively small increase in the amount
of the genome that can be studied, hence read depth will be the more important
consideration in almost all cases''
.. ``In the original RNA-seq protocols, following extensive DNase treatment, RNA
was typically converted into cDNA through random hexamer-primed reverse tran-
scription followed by second DNA strand synthesis''
.. ``The import- ance of this information in characterizing ncRNA and observing
antisense transcription is becoming increas- ingly evident.''
.. ``Illumina, 454 and SOLiD sequencing platforms have been used in bacterial
RNA-seq studies [27–29]. Each offers a different compromise between the length
of reads, which determines what proportion of the genome data can be uniquely
mapped to, and depth of coverage, which determines the dynamic range over which
gene expression can be quantified.''
.. ``After sequencing, reads can be assembled using software either based on
overlap graphs, such as EDENA [30], or de Bruijn graphs, for instance ABySS
[31], ALLPATHS [32] or Velvet [33], which features a strand-specific assembly
mode.''
.. ``a number of programs have been developed specifically for mapping short
read data [36–39], which often have the advantages of considering base quality
and read pair information when performing alignments.''
.. ``The results of mapping analyses have commonly been visualized as a graph of
sequence read coverage across a genome, displayed using software such as the
Integrated Genome Browser [40] or Artemis [41].''
.. ``With the introduction of specialist tools such as BamView [42], raw
sequence data can be visualized as well as coverage graphs, allowing a more
intuitive understanding of the transcriptional landscape (Figure 2).''
.. ``statistical methods have been developed to overcome this by modeling the
expected distributions of sequence reads mapping to a locus in different
samples. DEGseq [43] uses a Poisson distribution to model the variation between
datasets [44], whereas the approaches of edgeR [45] and DEseq [46] are based on
the negative binomial distribution, which is suggested to be more appropriate
for modeling the variation inherent between biological replicates [47].''
.. ``in both M. pneumoniae and H. pylori, annotation of transcriptional units
was complicated by an unexpectedly high level of flexibility in the structure
of operons [12,16]''
.. ``The use of protocols that sequence RNA in a strand- specific manner, and
identify transcriptional start sites, will prove especially useful in the
identification of ncRNA and defining the operons to which genes belong. Hence
there is the potential for this technique to greatly refine our understanding of
bacterial gene regulation.''
.. ``The advent of second generation sequencing technologies has 
improved functional genomics experiments, including
quantitative gene expression studies.''
