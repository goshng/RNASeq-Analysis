Test of GenomicRanges R package
===============================

I have two input files: a pileup file, and a transcripts-map file. Using the two
files I wish perform the following:

.Things To Do
. Load a ParseRNAseq output file or its BED file into a GenomicRanges or IRanges
object
. Load the pileup file as Rle or a vector object
. Find the number of transcripts
. Plot or summarize transcript lengths distribution
. Compute average pilup values of the transcripts
. Find genes covered by the transcripts
. Plot or summarize number of genes in the transcripts
. Find transcripts without annotated genes as putative non-coding elements
. Find transcripts with genes with conflicted strands
